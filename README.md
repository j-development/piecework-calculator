# piecework-calculator

Hello World!

Making a piecework-calculator for use in my daywork, in the process learning more about android-development, version control and programming in general.
The calculator will be used for calculating how long an order 'should' take using the pace(hourly wage) selected by the user.
An optional countdown is also added which can be started by the user

More functionality will be added as the project go along, like adding full timerfunctionilty to the countdown like alarmsound, pause resume etc.
Logs of some sort, making it possible to track every order and every orderpayment.
